PBKDF2 nitty gritty
    how many iterations to use?
        as many as you can stand
        - 4096: used by WPA
        - 10,000: used by iOS 4
        - 100,000: used by lastpass
        rule of thumb: whatever will take a couple seconds to compute
    sha256?
        I used HMAC-SHA1 for widest compatibility. At some point it will
        make sense to switch to HMAC-SHA256, which is supported by most
        of the libraries used by passforge.
        The attacks on SHA-1 published so far concern its resistance to
        collisions. This is not an important property from the standpoint of
        PBKDF2 or key generation, so it is not a cause for concern.
    vulnerable to rainbow tables
        higher iterations help somewhat
        ultimately, there is no protection for a weak master password
        passforge uses 4097 as "low" to thwart datasets precomputed for WPA
    can I use passforge to generate keys for encryption?
        It would make more sense to use PBKDF2 directly, but as long as you
        pick a random salt and a good passphrase, you should be OK.
    why not bcrypt or scrypt?
        If one of your generated passwords is leaked, passforge provides some
        protection against attempts to recover the master passphrase. It is
        much safer than using a single iteration of any hash function, even if
        you've used a weak master passphrase (not recommended). But attacks by
        GPUs or CPU clusters present a significant risk, and Moore's law makes
        this increase dramatically over time. The scrypt
        <http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html> algorithm is designed to be
        expensive in memory as well as processing power, which makes it orders
        of magnitude stronger against GPU brute force attempts.

        However, I wanted a simple, widely tested, and very portable algorithm
        for passforge. To my knowledge, there are no major implementations of
        scrypt besides Colin Percival's original C. While bcrypt is implemented
        in several languages, including a plausible looking javascript version,
        the algorithm is complex enough that it is difficult to check over. I
        wanted an algorithm that was simple enough for moderately saavy users
        to verify or even reimplement.

        Passforge may adopt one of these algorithms in a future version.

performance:
    really good in C
    decent in chrome / opera
        not as good in FF

other solutions:
    lastpass
        a great online password storage tool
        what if they're down?
        what if they go out of business or get bought?
        what if they're compromised?
            if the breach goes undetected and you log in, attacker gets all your data
        already use PBKDF2 for your master password
    GnuPG / keepass / other offline tool
        great offline password storage tools
        synchronization is up to you
    browser storage
        have to trust the browser with all your passwords
        what about non-browser tools?
        what about synchronization?
            work computer?
            phone browser?
