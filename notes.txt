PBKDF2 nitty gritty
    how many iterations to use?
        as many as you can stand
        - 4096: used by WPA
        - 100,000: used by lastpass
        rule of thumb: whatever will take a couple seconds to compute
    sha256?
        I used HMAC-SHA1 for widest compatibility. At some point it will
        make sense to switch to HMAC-SHA256, which is supported by most
        of the libraries used by passforge.

other solutions:
    lastpass
        a great online password storage tool
        what if they're down?
        what if they go out of business or get bought?
        what if they're compromised?
            if the breach goes undetected and you log in, attacker gets all your data
        already use PBKDF2 for your master password
    GnuPG / keepass / other offline tool
        great offline password storage tools
        synchronization is up to you
    browser storage
        have to trust the browser with all your passwords
        what about non-browser tools?
        what about synchronization?
            work computer?
            phone browser?

other no-storage solutions:
    oplop
        https://oplop.appspot.com/
        uses just one round of MD5
        "a mobile phone cannot run MD5 thousands of times very quickly"
            no longer true of modern phones
            my galaxy nexus can do 8,000 iterations of hmac-sha1 per second
        https://code.google.com/p/oplop/wiki/ThreatModel
    supergenpass
        http://supergenpass.com/faq/
        uses ~10 rounds of MD5
        slow because it's in javascript
